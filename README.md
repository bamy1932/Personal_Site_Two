This is my personal website project to use what I have learned so far to describe myself. This project was started on 01OCT24, working during class with Justice and Malcolm.
Photo commits were added to gitHub repository using the "pic" branch.
Alert message per assignment was added to gitHub repository using the "java" branch.
